# Block header endpoints

Block header endpoints return block headers from the chain database.
Similar to the block endpoints, block headers are generally returned in ascending order and include headers of orphaned blocks.

If you only want to query for blocks that are included in the winning branch of the chain, you can use the branch endpoint.
The branch endpoint returns blocks in descending order starting from the leafs of branches of the block chain.

Block headers are returned in three different formats depending on the format specified in the Accept header of the request:

- `application/json` returns block headers in as a base64Url encoded binary without padding.
- `application/json;blockheader-encoding=object` returns block headers in JSON encoding.
- `application/octet-stream` returns block headers as binary data if supported by the endpoint.

## Get block headers

Use `GET /chain/{chain}/header` to get block headers for the specified chain.
This call returns a collection of block headers in ascending order that satisfies the query parameters. 
All block headers that match the query criteria are returned from the chain database, including headers for orphaned blocks.

### Path parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description
| :--------- | :---- | :-----------
| chain (required) | integer >= 0 | Specifies the chain identifier of the chain you want to send the request to. Valid values are 0 to 19. For example, to get block headers for the first chain (0), the request is `GET /chain/0/header`.

### Query parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description
| --------- | ---- | -----------
| limit | integer >= 0 | Specifies the maximum number of records that should be returned. The actual number records might be lower.
| next | string | Specifies the cursor for the next page. This value can be found as the value of the next property of the previous page.
| minheight	| integer >= 0 | Specifies the minimum block height for the returned headers. For example: minheight=500000
| maxheight | integer >= 0 | Specifies the maximum block height for the returned headers. For example: maxheight=500000

### Responses

Requests to `/chain/{chain}/header` can return the following response codes:

- **200 OK** indicates that the request succeeded and returns a collection of block headers in **ascending** order. 
  All block headers that match the specified criteria are returned from the chain database, including headers for orphaned blocks.
- **404 Not Found** indicates that the `next` or `maxheight` parameter specifies a nonexistent block height.

#### Response headers

The response header parameters are the same for successful and unsuccessful requests.

| Parameter | Type | Description
| --------- | ---- | -----------
| x-peer-addr	| string | Specifies the host address and port number of the client as observed by the remote chainweb node in the format ^\d{4}.\d{4}.\d{4}.\d{4}:\d+$. For example: "10.36.1.3:42988"
| x-server-timestamp | integer >= 0 | Specifies the clock time of the remote chainweb node using the UNIX epoch timestamp. For example: 1618597601
| x-chainweb-node-version	| string | Specifies the version of the remote chainweb node. For example: "2.23"

```

## Get block header branches

Use `POST /chain/{chain}/header/branch` to return a page of block headers from branches of the block chain in **descending** order.
Only blocks that are ancestors of the same block in the set of upper bounds and are not ancestors of any block in the set of lower bounds are returned.

### Path parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description
| --------- | ---- | -----------
| chain (required) | integer >= 0 | Specifies the chain identifier of the chain you want to send the request to. Valid values are 0 to 19. For example, to get block headers for the first chain (0), the request is `GET /chain/0/header/branch`.

### Query parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description
| --------- | ---- | -----------
| limit | integer >= 0 | Specifies the maximum number of records that should be returned. The actual number of records might be lower.
| next | string | Specifies the cursor for the next page. This value can be found as the value of the next property of the previous page.
| minheight	| integer >= 0 | Specifies the minimum block height for the returned headers. For example: minheight=500000
| maxheight | integer >= 0 | Specifies the maximum block height for the returned headers. For example: maxheight=500000

### Request schema

These parameters specify the upper and lower bounds for the queried branches.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| lower	| Array of strings (Block Hash) | Specifies the lower bound for the query. No block hashes are returned that are predecessors of any block with a hash from this array. The block hash consists of 43 characters from the `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{43}$` character set. |
| upper | Array of strings (Block Hash) | Specifies the upper bound for the query. Returned block hashes are predecessors of a block with an hash from this array. This includes blocks with hashes from this array. The block hash consists of 43 characters from the `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{43}$` character set. |

The following examples illustrate the results to expect based on setting these parameters. 
For example, to return all of the ancestors of a block that are not ancestors of another block, you might specify bounds similar to the following:

```json
{
  "lower": [
    "RClyuyZAacwvPpmLXKbTwrIRXWeUSjiNhJVP2esH8KM"
  ],
  "upper": [
    "QxGCAz5AY1Y41nh1yWtgqhKhZ9pPiPRagFdIKNqBH74"
  ]
}
```

To return all ancestors of one block:

```json
{
  "lower": [],
  "upper": [
    "QxGCAz5AY1Y41nh1yWtgqhKhZ9pPiPRagFdIKNqBH74"
  ]
}
```

To return an empty branch:

```json
{
  "lower": [],
  "upper": []
}
```

To return an empty page:

```json
{
  "lower": [
    "QxGCAz5AY1Y41nh1yWtgqhKhZ9pPiPRagFdIKNqBH74"
  ],
  "upper": [
    "QxGCAz5AY1Y41nh1yWtgqhKhZ9pPiPRagFdIKNqBH74"
  ]
}
```

- **400 Bad Request** indicates that the branch bounds were exceeded.
- **404 Not Found** indicates that the block header indicated by a required parameter was not found.
